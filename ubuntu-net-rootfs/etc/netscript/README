Netscript Configuration files

The files found in this directory are for an alternative network configuration 
and IP filtering system for kernel 2.4+ based on /bin/sh. This system is 
designed for use with a routing daemon like zebra. This system also uses 
iproute

Most of what you should really have to edit is found in network.conf

The files and their uses are as follows:

network.conf:	general network, bridging, QoS and some ptables configuration 
		items. Comments in here contain the current documentation 
		on the configuration items, which can even handle pppd, 
		wanconfig, and ciped.
ipfilter.conf:	The shell script sused to set up the iptables 
		filtering/masquerading etc.
if.conf		Lower level functions for configuring interfaces.
qos.conf	Functions to configure Quality of Service using /sbin/tc

You should be able to do most things by editing the settings in network.conf.
See below for more details on this reccomended editing policy.

You will have to configure the firewall using the iptables commands directly.

Don't forget to save the configurations using the 
'netscript ipfilter|ip6filter save' commands! Unlike the last version, 
the firewalling and filtering is no longer configured from network.conf.  
This has been done as stateful filtering has helped obviate the need for 
great complexity in the firewall scripts, and  more flexibility is possible. 

It is a good idea to get down and get dirty with iptables and learn it, 
which you will appreciate if you are running this to build a network - you 
should understand things fully, or else you will get things wrong.
